# AGORA

Greek:
Αγορά (aɣɔˈɾa)

*[n]  feminine.*

* meaning: market, marketplace.

Agora is a website and app that brings users together to chat both privately and publicly through a web of categorised communities based on interests and hobbies.

* Note: this project uses the MySQL server with
	* workbench version: 8.0.31.CE and
	* server version: 8.1.0.

## Agora

The setup of our database.

Includes:
* Table setups and population.

## General

Some of the everyday queries we use in the running of our website and app.

Includes:
* A user deleting their account.
* A user purchasing Ambrosia (our membership).
* Viewing user statuses.

## Scenario

The scenario for this project is an 'End of Year Review' where the Agora team have convened to discuss changes that we can implement to improve user experiences.

Based on user feedback throughout the year, our goals are:
* Improving Ambrosia.
	* We consider the number of users in our sample dataset to determine the % who do not have an Ambrosia membership.
	* We also consider whether our most recent large Ambrosia update (on 29-05-2023) has seen an increase in users purchasing Ambrosia relative to before the update.

* Implementing new filtering features.
	* We seek to allows users to filter through posts by date, "liked", "disliked" and controversial.  

* User engagement in communities.
	* We consider the communities that users engage with the most and the least and use these findings to improve the services we offer.

* Extending existing features into new global regions.
	* We consider the activity of users in regions who cannot access all our features and services to determine whether there is motive to expanding our reach.

## Results

Below we report the outcome of our goals.

* Improving Ambrosia.
	* We found that less than 50% of our users *do not* have Ambrosia, meaning more than 50% do!
	* Although this is great news, we still plan to look into attracting more users to our membership and improving the UX for current members. In part using the results from this year's review.

	* Additionally, we saw that we have tripled the number of users who bought Ambrosia in the time period after our update compared to an identical time period before the update!

* Implementing new filtering features.
	* Successful demonstrations.

* User engagement in communities.
	* We saw that the gaming and beta communities were the most and least engaged in communities respectfully.
	* The latter is to be expected as it is a private community for the Agora team to discuss our beta versions.
	* The former can allow us to look into gaming incentives to attract more users to Ambrosia!
		* For example gaming points every month for users with Ambrosia and/or playing the game with friends via an Agora service.

* Extending existing features into new global regions.
	* Based on the posts in our 'Bugs' community, most of the users who were reporting bugs when attempting to use our features were from the Central American region. Therefore, this was the region we considered extending more into.
	* We found that one-third of users in our dataset were from Central America and they made 39% of the posts we sampled.
		* Based on these findings, there is clear interest from Central Americans in our services and we aim to look to improve and increase our features that are available in the region.

## Summary

Our aims for the coming year:

* Improve Ambrosia features to attract more memberships and upgrade current member experiences.
	* Look into gaming incentives and new website/app features for such.
* Implement search filters for post categories.
* Develop and build on the accessible features for the Central American region.
